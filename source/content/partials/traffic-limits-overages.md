## Traffic limits and overages

Pantheon optimizes the resources and performance of your site based on your choice of [pricing plan](https://pantheon.io/plans/pricing?docs). Your pricing plan determines the [backend resources](/guides/account-mgmt/plans/faq#plan-resources) Pantheon deploys to support site performance and to serve the corresponding traffic levels for each plan. Customers should choose the plan that suits their anticipated traffic and continually monitor that choice using [Pantheon's Site Dashboard](/metrics).

As your site grows on Pantheon, you can modify your plan based on the metrics you find in the Site Dashboard. If your traffic is over your plan limit, the site may be subject to overage fees. Aligning your site plan with the current traffic demands is the best way to ensure there will not be additional charges. In the event your site is over the plan limits the overages program is an easy-to-understand model based on actual site usage in the prior month. There is an [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaLJHXJJashwO9zsHFeywW-RQx_6uWOWH2Yr31sbQv4/edit?usp=sharing) to help you understand the specifics around how site traffic and overages are processed.

Pantheon monitors your site traffic as part of our evaluation of overall site health. To understand the limits associated with your pricing plan, visit the [pricing comparison page](https://pantheon.io/plans/pricing/pantheon-web-hosting-pricing-comparison?docs) for additional information.

### Overage protection

Pantheon designed overage protection for Performance and Elite sites on annual plans to prevent one-time traffic spikes from causing billing issues. All Performance plans and higher on an annual plan include one month of overage protection, which provides billing protection against externally driven spikes, or for businesses that have an annual “big event” but otherwise operate at a lower “normal” rate. This protection resets with the calendar year and will be automatically applied the first month of the year your site goes over its plan limits. You as the site owner do not need to do a thing. In a month where overage protection is applied the site owner will be notified of the event and no other action will be taken. This notice is a great time to review your site's traffic to determine if it is time to move to a new plan and avoid the risk of a future overages bill. Qualified nonprofits receive additional overage protection at no extra cost, automatically applied. Refer to the [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaLJHXJJashwO9zsHFeywW-RQx_6uWOWH2Yr31sbQv4/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more about how to qualify for these and other benefits available only to Pantheon's nonprofit customers.

If the change to traffic behavior exceeds your plan limit for a second month in any calendar year, you will receive notice of the traffic volume and the impact of the excess traffic. For credit card customers (those not on a contract) that will result in an invoice later that same month. For customers on contract overages will be billed quarterly. Refer to the [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaLJHXJJashwO9zsHFeywW-RQx_6uWOWH2Yr31sbQv4/edit?usp=sharing) for specifics on what to expect when you receive a notification that your site is over its plan limits.

<Alert title="Note" type="info">

Basic and Performance sites on a monthly plan do not have overage protection. If a site on a monthly plan exceeds the published visit cap in any given month, the site plan will be automatically be subject to a bill for the overage. The site owners will be notified of the event and an invoice will follow later int he same month.
